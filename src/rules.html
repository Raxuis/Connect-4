                <p>The Connect 4 game is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own
                    the
                    grid!

                    Players choose yellow or red discs. They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at
                    the
                    edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. Use strategy to block
                    opponents
                    while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win. The Connect 4 game is a great choice
                    for a
                    play date, a rainy day activity, or anytime your kids want a fun game to play with a friend. It's
                    fun to
                    go 4 the win! For ages 6 and up.</p>
